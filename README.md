# Simple Form App

This project is an example of a simple form developed just using `HTML`, `CSS` and `JavaScript`.

## 1. Product requirements

As a user when I view the application then I see a form containing a text box to enter a body of text and when I submit the form with some text then I see a result containing the number of words in the text box
and when I submit the form with an empty text then I see a form error telling me that some text input is required.

## 2. Relation between **Technical solutions** and **Product Requirements**

- **Requirement 1:** When I view the application then I see a form containing a text box to enter a body of text.

- **Solution 1:** It was created an `HTML` file to allow users to interact with the solution. The `CSS` file helps `HTML` to be a more beautiful solution.

- **Requirement 2:** When I submit the form with some text then I see a result containing the number of words in the text box.

- **Solution 2:** This feature was created by creating a vanilla `JavaScript` file with all necessary methods.

---

- **Requirement 3:** When I submit the form with an empty text then I see a form error telling me that some text input is required.

- **Solution:** This requirement was solved by setting textarea as a required form input.

## 4. Next steps suggestions

All points here are related to a general use case. A specific solution needs to be related to **Product requirements** or its **Roadmap**.

1. Validate if everything type is a word, not just a bunch of characters;
   
2. Improve the responsiveness of every `HTML` component;
   
3. Add spellchecker in the frontend;

4. Integrate to Backend solution to persist every user input in some Database. This action would allow further text analysis;
   
5. In the case of backend integration many filters could be developed on frontend.
